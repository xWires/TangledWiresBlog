FormatEverywhere has now been released! FormatEverywhere was originally just something I made to test some stuff, but I decided to turn it into something that I could actually release.

FormatEverywhere lets you use colour and formatting codes almost anywhere in Minecraft. Currently, it only adds the ability to use colour and formatting codes on: item names, books, and signs. If I think of any more then I'll add them as soon as I can!

Go here to learn more and to download FormatEverywhere from SpigotMC (and Modrinth once it's approved): [https://tangledwires.xyz/projects/formateverywhere](https://tangledwires.xyz/projects/formateverywhere)
