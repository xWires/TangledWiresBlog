Just a quick update on what's happening with PowerItemsPlus: development is going well so far, but now that Minecraft 1.21 is out and a lot of things work with it, I want PIP (PowerItemsPlus) to work there too. So there might be a bit of a delay whilst I figure out what I need to change to make it work properly on 1.21, then regular development will continue.

So far I've gotten rarities, abilities, and statistics working properly, but there's still a lot that I need to do before it's ready for release such as loading items from files, better commands, and potentially hex colour code support.
