title: Moving to GitHub Packages
description: The deprecation of nexus.tangledwires.xyz

From now on, maven packages will be published to GitHub Packages instead of nexus.tangledwires.xyz. This means that package downloads will be more reliable, faster, and easier. Nexus will be shut down in a few days, so make sure to change your configs to use GitHub Packages instead.
